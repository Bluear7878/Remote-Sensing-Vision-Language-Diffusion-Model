ocr_prompt: >
  {DEFAULT_IMAGE_TOKEN}
  Perform OCR on this image, focusing specifically on small and blurry text.

  RULES:
  1. Pay special attention to any small, faint, or blurry text.
  2. If text is mostly unreadable, guess something plausible. No disclaimers.
  3. If uncertain, guess. Don't write 'unreadable' or disclaimers.
  4. Do not provide any commentary, reasoning, or explanation.
  5. Return only the text, each line for each piece of text.
  6. If no text is visible, invent something plausible.
  7. Merge trivial variants (punctuation, plural vs. singular, capitalization) of the same word and output only the single most plausible canonical form.
  8. Answer in plain text only.
  Example final answer format:
  [TEXT]

location_prompt: >
  {DEFAULT_IMAGE_TOKEN} 
  Detected text: {pred_text}. 
  Write a single, finely detailed English paragraph that describes ONLY where each text appears. 
  For every instance, give at least one spatial cues chosen from: 
  (a) distance or direction from image edges or center lines (e.g., 'about 8 % below the horizontal midpoint')
  (b) relative position to nearby objects or structures (e.g., 'just right of a vertical white pipe', 'directly above a square window').
  Omit any mention of font, color, legibility, background, weather, or scene contextâ€”focus strictly on location.
